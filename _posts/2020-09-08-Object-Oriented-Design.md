### Analysis, Design and programming
1. Gather requirements
2. Describe the app
3. Identify the main objects
4. Describe the interactions
5. Create a class diagram 

### UML Class Diagram

| Name      | 
| :---------| 
| Attribute | 
| Methods   | 

### Designing the requirements
1. Functional Requirements
    
    The system must do ...

    The app must do ...
2. Non-functional Requirements

    The system should be ...

    The application should be ...

>  FURPS plus: design, implementation, interface, physical requirements

### Use Cases and User Storeis

1. Identify the actors

    * Cook meal.

    * Change settings.
