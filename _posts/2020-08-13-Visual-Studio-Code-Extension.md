title: Best Visual Studio Code Extensions for Developer in 2020
---

If you are a graduate or developer you will find these extensions really useful and essential. I hope I knew these tools when I study at uni. These Visual Studio Code extensions are categorized for general purpose, I hope you can enjoy finding some of them useful to help you code more efficiently.

# Autocompleter
“TabNine” and “Visual Studio IntelliCode” provide AI-assisted autocomplete to help you write code faster. TabNine supports all language, for example, C# while Visual Studio IntelliCode only supports Python, TypeScript/JavaScript and Java. You can install both of them.


# Efficiency
Install “Terminal” by Jun Hun, it will save a lot of time by running the terminal from the text editor. “stack-tabs” can keep the most recent files to the left. Definitely install “Bracket Pair Colorizer 2”, it is s customizable extension for colonizing matching brackets. It helps me in reducing time to find brackets I accidentally deleted.

# Formatter
“Prettier code formatter” and “Beautify” are quite popular. I personally prefer to user“Prettier code formatter” since it supports more languages. Try “EditorConfig for VS code” if you have more strict requirements for formatting.

# Icons Theme
“Material Icon Them” and “vscode-icons” can provide beautiful icons for files and folders using icons. I personally prefer to use “Material Icon Them” since I think it looks better.

# Highlight for Comments
“TODO Highlight” and “Better Comments” remind you to finish some TODO functions by highlighting your comments. I prefer to use “TODO Highlight” because it attracts more attention from me and easier to start.

# Markdown
“Instant Markdown” let you preview your markdown files as you type. 

# Git
“Git History”, “GitLens — Git supercharged”, “gitlink”, .gitignore Generator”, GitHub Pull Requests and Issues” are really popular in the market. If you haven’t install any extensions for git yet, definitely give them a try.

# Other Extensions
There are some other extensions recommended by other developers as well. I do not really use them at the moment so I will just list them here.
These are: better align, bookmarks, peacock, polacode, project manager, remote -ssh, setting sync, guides.
